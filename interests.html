                        <h3 class="interest__title">Credit Card Rewards</h3>
                        <p class="interest__description">I got my first credit card shortly before starting college to build my credit score as early as possible. While researching the best beginner/student credit card, I quickly realized understanding the ins and outs of credit
                            card rewards can allow you to multiply your earnings+redemption values (cash back), assuming you are financially responsible. Of all my credit cards, my favorite would be the JP Morgan Ritz Carlton card. It was discontinued in July 2018 but I obtained it
                            in Oct 2023 by product changing from a Marriot Bonvoy Bold after having it for one year. The card is a sleek black metal card (same construction as the Chase Sapphire Reserve [CSR]), but has better benefits than the CSR and AmEx Platinum (atleast for me).
                            With the card I get a $300 airline incidental credit, top tier priority pass membership (including $28 credit to several restaurants in SFO and unlimited guests for lounges), all-encompassing travel insurance, and an annual 85k Marriott free night 
                            certificate. 
                            <br><br>
                            An example of suboptimal point earning+redemption would be my brother flying United Airlines frequently and buying all his tickets with his Chase United Explorer card. Being a frequent United flyer with premier status, he didn't get any additional benefit 
                            purchasing United tickets with his Explorer card other than 2x United miles. Instead, I suggested he apply for the CSR which offers 3x on travel purchases (including United tickets), in addition to other benefits. At the time, the CSR's annual fee was 
                            $450, but is effectively $150 after subtracting the $300 travel credit (which my brother would use every year). More importantly, Chase Ultimate Rewards (UR) are worth more than United miles because you can transfer UR to partner airlines/hotels at a 
                            1:1 ratio (United included), some with typically higher redemption values such as Hyatt (~2.0 cents per point [cpp] vs United's 1.2 cpp). Transfering to certain airlines for first class tickets can easily have 10-20 cpp, but at a minimum UR are worth 1.5 
                            cpp for travel redemptions through Chase's portal with the CSR. Overall, my brother was conservatively losing out on ~3.6cpp (3x2.0 cpp - 2x1.2 cpp) for every dollar spent on United flights; meaning he would recoup the CSR annual fee in points with $4166.67 
                            spent annually on United flights ($1527.78 if he cancelled his Explorer [$95 annual fee]). And this doesn't include the sign-up bonus (60,000 UR = ~$1200) or other points he would earn by having the CSR be his new daily driver.

                        <p class="interest__description">My passion for fragrances started when I first entered college and didn't want to smell like every other person on campus. Wearing cologne wasn't common within my highschool and family, so I came in with an open mind. 
                            Like many other items I have bought, I enjoy taking the time to research, and eventually purchase, items which are unique/custom to me. Scents are such a subjective opinion, so I rank fragrances on the smell and how I feel wearing it, not what other 
                            people think. Initally I was like any other person first discovering the fragrance community: watching every reviewer's top 10 list and purchasing the most commonly mentioned colognes in hopes of getting the most compliments. However in actuality, you 
                            rarely receive the spontaneous compliment from a stranger, which is more likely a result of being personable rather than the fragrance itself. 
                            <br><br>
                            I received my first complement from a stranger in Oct 2023, after three full years of wearing fragrances daily. In fact, it was so surprising that I mistakened her question of "what are you wearing?" for my Boosted Board protection gear instead of the 
                            cologne I had on (Rochas Moustache for those curious and it was in the elevator on the ride up to the office in the morning). Ultimately, what drove me to the realization was smelling many "top 10" fragrances and discovering I disliked many of them. 
                            Unsurprisingly, I have a different scent preference, but my own preferences continue to change as I smell more fragrances. If I could give one advice to anyone thinking about purchasing a fragrance, it would be to never blind buy: always smell it in 
                            person (whether at the mall, fragrance store, or buying a sample online). It will save you invaluable time, money, and hassle when you discover you actually dislike the supposedly "10/10" fragrance.

                        <p class="interest__description">The pandemic made everyone appreciate the outdoors, and I was no exception. I had the opportunity to hike various trails around LA and visit several national parks (Zion, Bryce, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Park) 
                            with family while classes were still remote. Nothing motivated me more than being recommended, and subequently binging, Kraig Adams' pictureque and serene solo backpacking videos. There was something about the absolute quietness, where you could 
                            hear leaves rustle and the crunch of dirt with each step, overlayed on nature's backdrop that spawned the hiking itch within me. I haven't gotten the chance to go on a backpacking trip yet, but the Half-Dome hike at Yosemite is certainly at the 
                            top of the list. I highly recommend the AllTrails app for discovering top hikes in the area and purchasing the premium plan to track your hike without needing internet connection.

                        <p class="interest__description">I began cooking out of necessity once I moved into an off campus apartment my senior year. However, I found much joy in the task because I could make whatever I craved. I typically cook every meal other than when my friends 
                            want to eat outside. Not only does it save money and time, but the food is healthier and quicker to make with each repetition. I have a few go-to recipes when I am short on time, but I enjoy trying out new recipes over a chill weekend. On the first try, 
                            I will follow the recipe exactly, but after making a dish several times, I begin to understand how each ingredient affects the overall flavor and adjust to my liking. When it comes to cooking tips, I really enjoy watching Ethan Chlebowski's YouTube videos. 
                            Maybe it's the engineer in me, but he takes a scientific approach to cooking which allows me to fundamentally understand why a certain method is recommended.
                            <br><br>
                            I started learning to make cocktails because outside drinks are quite expensive, particularly for college students. My friends and I would often do a dinner+drinks night at one of our apartments and watch a movie/tv-show afterwards. Homemade cocktails 
                            also taste significantly better than bottom shelf liquor+random chaser when you are pre-gaming for a night out. The cost difference is minuscule, plus you won't end up estimating alcohol consumption since you'll be measuring each ingredient with a jigger. 
                            I enjoy watching Anders Erickson's YouTube videos for recipes. His video format not only provides the recipe, but also gives a nice history on the drink and occasionally some variations. If you are passionate about coffee, my friend and I like to call 
                            Anders the "alcoholic James Hoffmann". There's just something about Anders' video style and appearance that is very Hoffmann-esque.
