                        <p class="interest__description">I got my first credit card shortly before starting college to build my credit score as early as possible. While researching for the best beginner/student credit card, I quickly realized 
                            as long as you are financially responsible, knowing the ins and outs of credit card rewards can multiply your redemption values (cash back). For example, my brother flys United Airlines frequently and bought all his tickets with 
                            his Chase United Explorer card. However, being a frequent flyer, he didn't get any benefits purchasing United tickets with his Explorer card other than 2x United points. Instead, I suggested he apply for the Chase Sapphire Reserve (CSR) 
                            which offers 3x on travel purchases (including United tickets), in addition to other benefits. At the time, the CSR annual fee was $450, but is effectively $150 after subtracting the $300 travel credit which my brother would use every year. More 
                            importantly, Chase Ultimate Rewards (UR) are worth more than United points because you can transfer UR to partner airlines/hotels at a 1:1 ratio (United included) and United has lower redemption values among other Chase partners (~1.2cpp vs 2.0cpp). 
                            UR are typically valued at 2cpp because Hyatt redemptions are usually ~2cpp, but ultimately YMMV. First class tickets can easily have 10-20cpp, but at a minimum UR are worth 1.5cpp for travel redemptions through Chase with the CSR. Overall, my brother 
                            was conservatively losing out on ~3.6cpp (3x2.0cpp - 2x1.2cpp) for every dollar spent on United flights and would make back the CSR annual fee in points with $4166.67 annually spent on United flights ($1527.78 if he cancelled his Explorer 
                            [$95 annual fee]). And this doesn't include the sign-up bonus (60,000 UR = $1200) or other points he would earn by having the CSR be his new daily driver.

                        <p class="interest__description">My passion for fragrances started when I first entered college and didn't want to smell like every other guy on campus. Wearing cologne wasn't common within my highschool and family, so I came in with an open mind. 
                            Like many other items I have bought, I enjoy taking the time to research, and eventually purchase, items which are unique/custom to me. For fragrances, this entails scents that not only fit the occasion, but also ones I particularly 
                            enjoy. Scents are such a subjective opinion, so I rank them on the smell and how I feel wearing it, not what other people think. However, initally I was like any other person first discovering the fragrance community: 
                            watching every reviewer's top 10 list and purchasing the most commonly mentioned colognes in hopes of getting the most compliments. It took me a few years to realize that fragrances are an extension of your personality and you rarely receive the
                            spontaneous compliment from a stranger, which is more likely a result of being personable rather than the fragrance itself. Ultimately, what drove me to the realization was smelling many of these "top 10" fragrances and 
                            discovering that I disliked many of them. Unsurprisingly, I have a different scent preference, but my own preferences continue to change as I smell more fragrances. If I could give one advice to anyone thinking about purchasing a fragrance, 
                            it would be to never blind buy: always smell it in person (whether at the mall, fragrance store, or buying a sample online). It will save you invaluable time, money, and hassle when you discover you actuslly dislike the supposedly "10/10" fragrance.

                        <p class="interest__description">The pandemic made everyone appreciate the outdoors, and I was no exception. I had the opportunity to hike various trails around LA and visit several national parks (Zion, Bryce, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Park) 
                            with family while classes were still remote. Nothing motivated me more than being recommended, and subequently binging, Kraig Adams' pictureque and serene solo backpacking videos. There was something about the absolute quietness, where you could 
                            hear leaves rustle and the crunch of dirt with each step, overlayed on nature's backdrop that spawned the hiking itch within me. I haven't gotten the chance to go on a backpacking trip yet, but the Half-Dome hike at Yosemite is certainly at the 
                            top of the list. I highly recommend the AllTrails app for discovering top hikes in the area and purchasing the premium plan to track your hike without needing internet connection.

                        <p class="interest__description">I began cooking out of necessity once I moved into an off campus apartment my senior year. However, I found much joy in the task because I could make whatever I craved. Typically I cook every meal other than when 
                            my friends want to eat outside. Not only do I save money and time, but the food is healthier and quicker to make with each repetition. I have a few go-to recipes when I am short on time, but I enjoy trying out new recipes over a chill weekend.
                            On the first try, I will follow the recipe to a t. But after making a dish several times, I begin to understand how each ingredient affects the overall flavor and adjust to my liking. When it comes to cooking tips, I really enjoy watching 
                            J. Kenji Lopez-Alt and Ethan Chlebowski's YouTube videos. Maybe it's the engineer in me, but they both take a scientific approach to cooking which allows me to fundamentally understand why a certain method is recommended/superior.
                            <br><br>
                            I started learning to make cocktails because outside drinks are quite expensive, particularly for college students. My friends and I would often do a dinner + drinks night at one of our apartments and watch a movie/tv-show afterwards. But 
                            homemade cocktails also taste infinetely better than bottom shelf liquor + random chaser when you are pre-gaming for a night out. The cost difference is incremental, plus you can keep track of exact alcohol consumption since you'll be
                            measuring each ingredient with a jigger. I enjoy watching Anders Erickson's YouTube videos when making a cocktail. His video format not only provides the recipe, but also gives a nice history on the drink and variations on occasion. If 
                            you are passionate about coffee, my friend and I like to call Anders the alcoholic James Hoffmann. There's just something about Anders' video style and appearnace that is very Hoffmann-esque.
